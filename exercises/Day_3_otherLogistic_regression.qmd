# Exercise 3
data(infert, package = "datasets")


```

## Exercise 1

Using data from 205 patients diagnosed with malignant melanoma in Denmark, we would like to explore the odds of dying (versus staying alive) in relationship to the presence of tumor ulceration. Ulceration is a breakdown of the skin on top of the melanoma and is an independent predictor of melanoma survival according to the literature. 

For our purposes we assume that patients' status was measured at a fixed period after melanoma diagnosis, such that probabilities can be interpreted as risks.


<!-- #.....................................................................# -->

#### (a) Manual calculation of odds ratios
Cross-tabulate the variables `status` and `ulcer` to manually calculate and interpret 

i) the odds ratio of dying from melanoma versus staying alive and 
ii) the odds ratio of dying from other causes versus staying alive in patients with tumor ulceration compared to patients without ulceration. 

```{r}

Melanoma$status <- factor(Melanoma$status, levels = c(1, 2, 3), labels = c(
  "death from melanoma", "alive", "death from other causes"))

Melanoma$ulcer <- factor(Melanoma$ulcer, levels = c(0, 1), 
                         labels = c("absent", "present"))


tab_statUlcer <- table(Melanoma$status, Melanoma$ulcer)

mosaicplot(tab_statUlcer, main = "Melanoma", xlab = "status",
           ylab = "ulceration")


tab_statUlcer_pt <- rbind(tab_statUlcer, colSums(tab_statUlcer))
tab_statUlcer_pt <- cbind(tab_statUlcer_pt, rowSums(tab_statUlcer_pt))


row.names(tab_statUlcer_pt) <- c(row.names(tab_statUlcer), "total")

colnames(tab_statUlcer_pt) <- c(colnames(tab_statUlcer), "total")

tab_statUlcer_pt


# OR_12 = ((41/90) / (42/90)) / ((16/115) / (92/115)) = (41/42) / (16/92)
OR_12 <- (41 * 92) / (42 * 16) 
OR_12

# OR_32 = ((7/90) / (42/90)) / ((7/115) / (92/115)) = (7/42) / (7/92)
OR_32 <- (7 * 92) / (42 * 7) 
OR_32

```


<!-- #.....................................................................# -->

#### (b) Univariable multinomial model
Fit a multinomial model with status as dependent variable and ulcer as explanatory variable. Which estimated coefficients show the odds ratios calculated in (a)? Calculate their 95% confidence intervals. Is there evidence for an association between tumor ulceration and the different odds of death?

**Hints:** to set the reference levels of a factor, use function `relevel()`. To calculate confidence intervals for model estimated coefficients, use function `confint()` or `tidy()` from package `broom`.
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Set the reference levels of the variables "status" and 
# "ulcer":
Melanoma$status <- relevel(Melanoma$status, ref = "alive")
Melanoma$ulcer <- relevel(Melanoma$ulcer, ref = "absent")


multinom_melanom <- multinom(status ~ ulcer, data = Melanoma)

summary(multinom_melanom)

exp(coef(multinom_melanom))
exp(confint(multinom_melanom, level = 0.95))

```


<!-- #.....................................................................# -->

#### (c) Multivariable multinomial model
Assess again the association of tumor ulceration with the different odds of dying versus staying alive after adjusting the multinomial model for patients' age and sex. Check how the estimated odds ratios change and calculate their confidence intervals.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}

multinom_melanom2 <- multinom(status ~ ulcer + age + sex, data = Melanoma)

```

```{r}

summary(multinom_melanom2)


exp(coef(multinom_melanom2))
exp(confint(multinom_melanom2, level = 0.95))

```


<!-- #.....................................................................# -->

#### (d) Odds estimated from the multivariable multinomial model
What is the odds of dying from melanoma for a 75-year old man without tumor ulceration?

**Hint:** the reference level of variable sex is 0 = female. The odds in question can be calculated manually just by looking the model estimated coefficients, but also using the output of `predict()`.
```{r}

exp(-2.703762 + 0.01474460 * 75 + 0.5749964) 

# or

pred_noUlcer_75_male <- predict(
  multinom_melanom2, newdata = data.frame(ulcer = "absent", age = 75, sex = 1),
  type = "probs")

pred_noUlcer_75_male["death from melanoma"] / pred_noUlcer_75_male["alive"]


```


<!-- #.....................................................................# -->

#### (e) Probabilities estimated from the multivariable multinomial model
Calculate the probability of dying from melanoma for a 50-year old woman with tumor ulceration.

**Hint:** Use function `predict()`. The probability in question can be also calculated manually given the model-estimated odds:

$$log \biggl(\frac{P[status = \textit{death from melanoma} \ | \ ulcer = present]}{P[status = alive \ | \ ulcer = present]} \biggr)$$
$$log \biggl(\frac{P[status = \textit{death from other causes} \ | \ ulcer = present]}{P[status = alive \ | \ ulcer = present]} \biggr)$$
and given that
$$P[status = \textit{death from melanoma} \ | \ ulcer = present] + P[status = \textit{death from other causes} \ | \ ulcer = present] + P[status = alive \ | \ ulcer = present] = 1$$

```{r}

predict(
  multinom_melanom2, newdata = data.frame(ulcer = "present", age = 50, sex = 0),
  type = "probs")


# Manual calculation:
# The odds of dying from melanoma versus staying alive for a 50-year old woman
# with tumor ulceration is:
# exp(-2.703762 + 1.6152588 + 0.01474460 * 50) = 0.7037915

# This odds is equal to the probability of dying from melanoma over the 
# probability of staying alive for a 50-year old woman with tumor ulceration:

# P[status = "death from melanoma" | ulcer = "present"] / P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"] = 0.7037915

# meaning that:
# P[status = "death from melanoma" | ulcer = "present"] = 0.7037915 * P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"]


# The odds of dying from other causes versus staying alive for a 50-year old 
# woman with tumor ulceration is:
# exp(-6.419789 + 0.4821069 + 0.06459613 * 50) = 0.06667831

# This odds is equal to the probability of dying from from other causes over the 
# probability of staying alive for a 50-year old woman with tumor ulceration.

# P[status = "death from other causes" | ulcer = "present"] / P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"] = 0.06667831

# meaning that:
# P[status = "death from other causes" | ulcer = "present"] = 0.06667831 * P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"]


# We also know that: 
# P[status = "death from melanoma" | ulcer = "present"] + 
#   P[status = "death from other causes" | ulcer = "present"] +
#   P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"] = 1

# meaning that:
# P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"] = 1 - P[status = "death from melanoma" | ulcer = "present"] -
#   P[status = "death from other causes" | ulcer = "present"]
# P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"] = 1 - 0.06667831 * P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"] -
#   0.7037915 * P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"]
# P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"] = 1 - 0.06667831 * P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"] -
#   0.7037915 * P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"]
# P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"] = 1 - 0.7704698 * P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"]
# P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"] + 0.7704698 * P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"] = 1
# 1.77047 * P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"] = 1
# P[status = "alive" | ulcer = "present"] = 1 / 1.77047 = 0.5648218

# Now we can can calculate the  probability of dying from melanoma for a 50-year 
# old woman with tumor ulceration:
# P[status = "death from melanoma" | ulcer = "present"] = 0.7037915 * 0.5648218 = 0.3975168

## Exercise 2

Using data from a questionnaire on the benefits of mammography (source:  Applied Logistic Regression, 2nd edition, by Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000) completed by 412 women, we would like to investigate women's agreement to the statement: ‘You do not need a mammogram unless you develop symptoms.’, depending on their mother's and sister's breast cancer history.

```{r}

tab_SYMPT_HIST <- table(mammoexp$SYMPT, mammoexp$HIST)

mosaicplot(t(tab_SYMPT_HIST), 
           xlab = "Mother or sister with breast cancer",
           ylab = "No need for mammogram before symptoms", main = "")


tab_SYMPT_HIST <- rbind(tab_SYMPT_HIST, colSums(tab_SYMPT_HIST))
tab_SYMPT_HIST <- cbind(tab_SYMPT_HIST, rowSums(tab_SYMPT_HIST))


row.names(tab_SYMPT_HIST) <- c(
  row.names(tab_SYMPT_HIST)[-nrow(tab_SYMPT_HIST)], "total")

colnames(tab_SYMPT_HIST) <- c(
  colnames(tab_SYMPT_HIST)[-ncol(tab_SYMPT_HIST)], "total")

tab_SYMPT_HIST

```


<!-- #.....................................................................# -->

#### (a) Univariable ordinal logistic regression model
Fit an ordinal logistic regression model with `SYMPT` as dependent variable and `HIST` as explanatory variable. Which coefficient shows the change in the log-odds for women with a mother and/or sister with breast cancer history)? Is there evidence for an association between women's agreement to the statement and their mother's and sister's breast cancer history?

```{r, message = FALSE}

ordLog_mammo <- polr(SYMPT ~ HIST, data = mammoexp, method = "logistic")

ordLog_mammo_sum <- summary(ordLog_mammo)
ordLog_mammo_sum

exp(ordLog_mammo_sum$coefficients)

exp(confint(ordLog_mammo, level = 0.95))

```


<!-- #.....................................................................# -->

#### (b) Odds estimated from the univariable ordinal logistic model
What's the odds of strongly agreeing or agreeing versus disagreeing or strongly disagreeing to the statement of interest for women with a mother and/or sister with breast cancer history, and for women whose mother and sister didn't have breast cancer history? What do the other intercepts mean?

```{r}

exp(ordLog_mammo_sum$coefficients["Agree|Disagree", "Value"] - 
      ordLog_mammo_sum$coefficients["HISTYes", "Value"]) 

exp(ordLog_mammo_sum$coefficients["Agree|Disagree", "Value"]) 

```


<!-- #.....................................................................# -->

#### (c) Proportional odds assumption meaning and visualization
The ordinal logistic model we fitted in (a) assumes proportionality of odds. What does this mean? Try to visualize this hypothesis.

```{r}

plot(x = 1, ylim = c(-3, 3), xlim = c(0, 1), type = "n", xaxs = "i", xaxt = "n",
     yaxt = "n", yaxs = "i", ylab = "log(odds)", 
     xlab = "mother and/or sister with breast cancer history")
axis(side = 1, at = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes"))
axis(side = 2, at = round(ordLog_mammo_sum$coefficients[
  which(row.names(ordLog_mammo_sum$coefficients) != "HISTYes"), "Value"], 3),
  las = 1, cex.axis = 0.7)


abline(coef = c(
  ordLog_mammo_sum$coefficients["Strongly Agree|Agree", "Value"],
  -ordLog_mammo_sum$coefficients["HISTYes", "Value"]), col = "red")

abline(coef = c(
  ordLog_mammo_sum$coefficients["Agree|Disagree", "Value"],
  -ordLog_mammo_sum$coefficients["HISTYes", "Value"]), col = "blue")

abline(coef = c(
  ordLog_mammo_sum$coefficients["Disagree|Strongly Disagree", "Value"],
  -ordLog_mammo_sum$coefficients["HISTYes", "Value"]), col = "green")

legend("topright", col = c("red", "blue", "green"), lty = rep(1, 3), legend = c(
  "Strongly Agree|Agree", "Agree|Disagree", "Disagree|Strongly Disagree"),
  cex = 0.8)


```


<!-- #.....................................................................# -->

#### (d) Univariable multinomial regression model
After fitting a multinomial model to the data (again with `SYMPT` as dependent variable and `HIST` as explanatory variable), calculate the log-odds estimated by the ordinal logistic model given the probabilities estimated from the multinomial model.

**Hint:** Use `predict()` plugging in the multinomial model to estimate the following probabilities:

* probability of strongly agreeing to the statement for women with a mother and/or sister with breast cancer history and for women without breast cancer history

* probability of agreeing to the statement for women with a mother and/or sister with breast cancer history  and for women without breast cancer history 

* probability of disagreeing to the statement for women with a mother and/or sister with breast cancer history and for women without breast cancer history

* probability of strongly disagreeing to the statement for women with a mother and/or sister with breast cancer history and for women without breast cancer history

We have to then plug these probabilities into the following log-odds:

* $log \biggl(\frac{P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Agree} \ | \ HIST = No]}{P[SYMPT = \textit{Agree or Disagree or Strongly Disagree} \ | \ HIST = No]} \biggr) = log \biggl(\frac{P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Agree} \ | \ HIST = No]}{P[SYMPT = \textit{Agree} \ | \ HIST = No] + P[SYMPT = \textit{Disagree} \ | \ HIST = No] + P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Disagree} \ | \ HIST = No]} \biggr)$

* $log \biggl(\frac{P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Agree or Agree} \ | \ HIST = No]}{P[SYMPT = \textit{Disagree or Strongly Disagree} \ | \ HIST = No]} \biggr) = log \biggl(\frac{P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Agree} \ | \ HIST = No] + P[SYMPT = \textit{Agree} \ | \ HIST = No]}{P[SYMPT = \textit{Disagree} \ | \ HIST = No] + P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Disagree} \ | \ HIST = No]} \biggr)$

* $log \biggl(\frac{P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Agree or Agree or Disagree} \ | \ HIST = No]}{P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Disagree} \ | \ HIST = No]} \biggr) = log \biggl(\frac{P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Agree} \ | \ HIST = No] + P[SYMPT = \textit{Agree} \ | \ HIST = No] + P[SYMPT = \textit{Disagree} \ | \ HIST = No]}{P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Disagree} \ | \ HIST = No]} \biggr)$

* $log \biggl(\frac{P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Agree} \ | \ HIST = Yes]}{P[SYMPT = \textit{Agree or Disagree or Strongly Disagree} \ | \ HIST = Yes]} \biggr) = log \biggl(\frac{P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Agree} \ | \ HIST = Yes]}{P[SYMPT = \textit{Agree} \ | \ HIST = Yes] + P[SYMPT = \textit{Disagree} \ | \ HIST = Yes] + P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Disagree} \ | \ HIST = Yes]} \biggr)$

* $log \biggl(\frac{P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Agree or Agree} \ | \ HIST = Yes]}{P[SYMPT = \textit{Disagree or Strongly Disagree} \ | \ HIST = Yes]} \biggr) = log \biggl(\frac{P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Agree} \ | \ HIST = Yes] + P[SYMPT = \textit{Agree} \ | \ HIST = Yes]}{P[SYMPT = \textit{Disagree} \ | \ HIST = Yes] + P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Disagree} \ | \ HIST = Yes]} \biggr)$

* $log \biggl(\frac{P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Agree or Agree or Disagree} \ | \ HIST = Yes]}{P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Disagree} \ | \ HIST = Yes]} \biggr) = log \biggl(\frac{P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Agree} \ | \ HIST = Yes] + P[SYMPT = \textit{Agree} \ | \ HIST = Yes] + P[SYMPT = \textit{Disagree} \ | \ HIST = Yes]}{P[SYMPT = \textit{Strongly Disagree} \ | \ HIST = Yes]} \biggr)$

## Exercise 3
For this exercise we use data from a matched case-control study that investigated the role of abortions in the aetiology of secondary infertility, including 100 women admitted to the University of Athens Medical School. For every patient, two healthy control subjects from the same hospital with matching age, parity, and level of education were found.

#### (a) Conditional logistic regression model
Fit a conditional logistic regression model including the number of prior induced and prior spontaneous abortions as explanatory variables. What is the impact of abortions on the risk of secondary infertility in women?

```{r}

condLog_infer <- clogit(case ~ spontaneous + induced + strata(stratum), 
                        data = infert)

summary(condLog_infer)

```
