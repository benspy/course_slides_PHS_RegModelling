|Day | Time | Content  
|--- |--- | --------------------    
|**Mon**| **AM** | **Simple linear regression**
|||	Refresher: p-values, confidence intervals, correlation, two sample $t$-test, ANOVA
|||	Fitting the simple linear regression model (least squares estimation) 
|||	Assessing model (fit, $R^2$)
|   | **PM** | **Multiple linear regression**
|||	The linear model (assumptions and misconceptions)

|||	Multicollinearity (variance inflation factor)
|||	Residual analysis (Residual plots, leverage, QQ-plot)
|**Tue**| **AM** | **Introduction to logistic regression**
|||	Generalising the linear model (link functions, maximum likelihood estimation)

|||	Interpretating of coefficients (logits, odds ratios)
|||	Interactions
|   | **PM** | **Model building considerations and strategies**
|||	Testing (Wald and likelihood ratio tests)
