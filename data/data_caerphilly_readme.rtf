\f0\fs20 \cf0 A sample of 1786 men who took part in the Caerphilly study, a study of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Participants\
were aged between 43 and 61 when they were first examined, and were followed for up to 19 years. The first examinations took place between July 1979 and October 1983, and the follow-up for the outcome (myocardial infarction or death from heart disease) ended in February 1999. Further information about the study can be found at www.epi.bris.ac.uk/mrc-caerphilly.}
